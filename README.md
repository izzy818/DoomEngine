# DoomEngine
Final year capstone project

This is my final year Capstone project completed for University of Essex 2022

The project brief was to create a DOOM-style engine entirely from scratch,
without the use of any third party programs, such as Unity.

The program was created in Java over the course of 7 months, using Agile
methodology and Jira to create and set deadlines, and track progress.
